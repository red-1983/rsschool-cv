2. ## About me:  
I am 40 years old. Two years ago I started to get involved in front-end development. My main goal is to learn how to create interesting applications and high-quality websites. My strengths are perseverance, diligence, the desire to learn something new. I have no experience in the company. I am in the formative stage right now. During self-study, I practiced and developed from the layout in Figma to uploading and setting up the websites mfs.by and reyt.by in Google and Yandex. Although these websites are not perfect, but this is my personal experience. And I will continue to improve.

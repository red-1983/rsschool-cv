2. ## About me:  
Hello, I'm Yuri. Three years ago I started doing frontend development. My main goal is to learn how to create interesting applications and high-quality websites. My strengths are persistence, hard work, and the desire to learn something new. I have no experience working in a company, but I do have experience working as a freelancer. I like what I do and I will continue to develop in this direction. The most valuable thing in this world is time, so let’s not waste it and let’s do what we like.
